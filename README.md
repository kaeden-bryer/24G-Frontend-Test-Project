## Description

An Anthology of Holiday Drink Recipes curated by 24G. Created with Vite + React and TailwindCSS. Hosted on GitHub pages. Responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop views.

## How to Run

This site is live and published using GitHub pages. However, if you would like to download and run this repository, you can clone this repository and run "npm i" or "pnpm i" to install all dependencies. Then, run "npm run dev" or "pnpm run dev" to host it locally.

## Reflection on the Experience

This was a really fun weekend project and a good experience to have under my belt. I have some experience in React and webdev already, so most things here were already familiar territory. However, there were a couple things that were new to me and proved to be a good learning experience.

1. Styling a Scrollbar

This was my first time learning how to style a scrollbar using ::-webkit-scrollbar. It makes me wonder what other things I can style using ::-webkit elements.

2. Responsive Web Development

I've come across responsive web development before, and was generally aware of how to use media queries to specifiy how elements should style on different sized screens. I've also been in the habit of using rems, flexbox, percentages and vw vh, all of which help create responsive web design. However, at my internship at Tyler Technologies, all applications were assumed to only be viewed on desktop. So this was my first real foray to getting my hands dirty and designing something responsive to mobile and tablet views.

Since I'm used to designing websites for desktops, I designed the entire site for desktop first. This threw me for a curveball once I started implementing responsiveness, because Tailwind uses a "mobile-first breakpoint system". Luckily, there wasn't a lot I had to refactor since this is a relatively small project. However, now I have better design principles in mind for the future.

3. Great refresh on React

I used Angular throughout the entirety of my time at Tyler, so honestly, that's what I know best. However, being a university student, I know it's more valuable to have strong React skills to work with other classmates (since it's the framework everyone learns first). I've used React before, and thought this woul be great chance to refresh on using React. In particular, this was a great refresh on the structure of a React app, passing props between components, and using TailwindCSS.

I'm really happy with what I've created. I did my best to add some love to it, and not just submit a thoughtless AI generated product. Hopefully you'll like it too :)
